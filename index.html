        <p> Football is my favorite hobby because it's fun, you get exercise, and you get to play with friends. you also get to meet new people on your team. I'm 10 years old and in 5th grade. there are so many different sports that I like that include baseball,soccer,swimming,basketball,golf, and of course football. But football is my favorite because there is a lot of action. </p>
